## Domains

Tranfering a domain from Squarespace to Cloudflare includes the following steps:

1. Go to "Account Home" and click "Add Domain". This should be one you already own.
2. Select the free plan
3. Double check that the records are all present, then click "Continue to Activation"
4. This gives you two nameservers to update in Squarespace
