## Mac Screenshots

When developing apps and you need a screenshot of the app with the device frame, you can open it up in XCode's Simulator, then run `cmd + shift + 5`, then make sure you take a screenshot of the window. Make sure to hold down `alt` in order to remove the shadow. Then just edit the image to remove the top portion.

## Preferences

- Set up default File when opening finder
  - Finder > Preferences > General > New Finder windows show: \<select folder\>

- Set up where to save screenshots. Enter the following in the terminal

- For using `space` for things like cancel, or replace, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Select the box that says `Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls`
