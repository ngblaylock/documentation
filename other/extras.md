# Extras

This is just a bunch of extra features that I like to have close by. 

## Folder Icons

I find it fun to customize some folders so they stand out a little more. On Mac OS Catalina, you can get system icons. Simply go to `Finder > Go > Go to Folder` and paste in the path below.

```
/System/Library/CoreServices/C­oreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resou­rces
```

Copy the file to a temporary location, such as downloads. Open the file, then export it as a `.png` format. Pull it into Photoshop, and do your magic.
